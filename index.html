        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Growing up, I was always told that I "think like a robot." I suppose I took that to heart (or should I say to my PSU) because I decided to learn how to talk to computers.
            I learned full-stack developer skills from the University of Pennsylvania's LPS Coding Bootcamp.
            At first, it was a drastic change from my previous careers as an English Professor and a Corporate Accountant.
            But I quickly found that both careers played a foundational role to my understanding of coding.
            From English, I brought creativity, a perpensity for syntax and grammar, and a constant conceptualization of how form and design informs function and communication.
            From Accounting, I brought efficiency, accuracy, and precision, in a field where attention-to-detail is equally critical.
