# <Portfolio-Page>

## Description

This website provides potential employers with the opportunity to preview my skills with web development. Both the webpage itself, and the provided links to my other projects, offer the potential employer a visual guide of my work and my range of abilities.

As I don't currently have any projects created yet (at the beginning of my bootcamp learning experience), I used placeholder pictures. The pictures are of different computer greeks from various fandoms. In order to show that my links work (without having any projects to link to yet), I provided links for each picture that will take the user to the fandom pages that correspond to that image.

## Installation

Simply follow the provided links below to view both the webpage itself and the GitHub repo for it.
